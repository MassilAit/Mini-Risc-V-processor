# Mini RISC-V Processor Implementation

This project implements a **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU core** in VHDL, synthesized and physically implemented using Cadence tools and the **GPDK045** 45 nm technology. It follows a full **VLSI design flow**, including simulation, synthesis, place-and-route, and timing analysis.

---

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

The processor was designed from scratch in VHDL, supporting essential RISC-V instructions, with all pipeline stages implemented and verified:

- **Fetch**
- **Decode**
- **Execute**
- **Memory**
- **Write-back**

The design was verified through **behavioral simulation** (pre-synthesis) and **timing simulation** (post-synthesis and post-layout netlists). Physical implementation was performed with automated Cadence flows.

## ðŸ“Š Physical Implementation

The project uses industry-standard design constraints:

- **`timing.sdc`** â€” Defines the timing environment (clocks, delays, input/output constraints, uncertainties, false paths).
- **`mmmc.tcl`** â€” Sets up Multi-Mode Multi-Corner (MMMC) analysis, specifying PVT corners, RC corners, and library sets for both **setup** (slow corner) and **hold** (fast corner) analysis.

The **placement and routing** stage was carried out using the Cadence Innovus flow with scripts in `scripts/` to automate each step.
